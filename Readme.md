Just updated my adaptive markup skills. On the simple CSS\HTML\JS without any frameworks.

You can run this site on the PC, mac, smartphone, or some tablet, it will run without troubles.

To run this application just open index.html in your browser (Opera, Chrome, IE - whatever ).

Have a nice and sunny day!
